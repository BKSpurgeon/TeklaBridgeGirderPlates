# Tekla Bridge Girder Plates

### Explanation of the Code

This is a code sample that:

  1. Builds contour plates, with

  2. Bolts. ...with the contour plates being tapered. This required a tiny bit of linear algebra.

All the inputs are read in from a CSV file.

I had to add a report which tells us if the plates are not planar. The bolts are all aligned to the plane of the plates. They need to be fairly accurate - 10 microns to be precise - according to the infinite wisdom of the Victorian Government engineer.

Hopefully the code is clear enough to give you something to start with.

### Warning: Gripe Alert

* We received an order to create bridge plate girders. As usual, design drawings and were poor. 
* Victorian government engineer wanted these plates to a tolerance of 10 microns. Yes, you read that correctly. 
* Not sure why this type of accuracy is necessary, or even possible, given we are building a bridge. 
* I must spent an additional 28 hours dealing with the back-and-forth rigmarole - plus dealing our client was a headache as well. * Massive headache. Anyways, it's water under the Westgate bridge (pun intended). Will not be working for that guy ever again. 
* Here is the standard business model of those in the Victorian construction industry: (i) procure goods & services, and (ii) don't pay. What could be more Victorian? Add in the cost of the imbeciles in our public service, the blatant rorting + union headaches, and it's pretty easy why an infrastructure project should have a cost blow out of x5 its initial costing estimates. The poor tax payer is taken for a ride.
