# Tekla Bridge Girder Plates

### Explanation of the Code

This is a code sample that:

  (i) Builds contour plates, with

  (ii) bolts

  (iii) with the contour plates being tapered.
  
I had to add a report which tells us if the plates are not planar. The bolts are all aligned to the plane of the plates. They need to be fairly accurate - 10 microns to be precise - according to the infinite wisdom of the Victorian Government engineer.

Hopefully the code is clear enough to give you something to start with.

### Demo:

All the inputs are read in from a CSV file.

### Warning: Gripe Alert

* We received an order to create bridge plate girders. As usual, design drawings and were poor. 
* Government engineer wanted these plates to a tolerance of 10 microns. Yes, you read that correctly. Not sure why this type of accuracy is necessary, or even possible, given we are building a bridge. 
* I must spent an additional 28 hours dealing with the back-and-forth rigmarole, plus dealing with gov's engineer. Was not paid for a single cent for it too.
* Massive headache. Anyways, it's water under the Westgate bridge (pun intended). Will not be working for that guy ever again. I suppose that's the business of model of anyone invovled in building and construction in Victoria: promise payment and then don't deliver, borrow and don't repay. What could be more Australian?
