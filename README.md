### Warning: Gripe Alert

* We received an order to create bridge plate girders. As usual, design drawings and were poor. 
* Government engineer wanted these plates to a tolerance of 10 microns. Yes, you read that correctly. Not sure why this type of accuracy is necessary, or even possible, given we are building a bridge. 
* I must spent an additional 28 hours dealing with the back-and-forth rigmarole, plus dealing with gov's engineer. Was not paid for a single cent for it too.
* Massive headache. Anyways, it's water under the bridge. Will not be working for that client ever again - at least until he pays for those 28 hours - which he refused. I suppose that's the business of model of anyone invovled in building and construction in Victoria.
